Kubernetes is a critical platform for executing any application using containers and a core technology for cloud-native solutions. The CKAD certification targets tech professionals responsible for designing, building, and deploying cloud-native applications using Kubernetes. In this course, solutions architect and Microsoft MVP Rodrigo Díaz Concha guides you through the topics covered on the CKAD certification exam. Find out about container images, Jobs, CronJobs, and multi-container Pod design patterns. Explore persistent volumes, and ephemeral volumes. Learn about deployments, rolling updates, and the Helm package manager. Go over application observability and maintenance, as well as application environment, configuration, and security. Plus, get the information you’ll need to understand on services and networking.
